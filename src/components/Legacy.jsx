          Glitch might have been just a chill guy, but his energy transformed
          the financial dreams of thousands. Today, his image is everywhere—from
          TikTok feeds to crypto wallets. People still post the meme, not
          because they need proof, but because they want to believe. “4 Good
          Fortune” is more than a tagline; it’s a way of life.
          So, what are you waiting for? Post the meme. Grab some $MONEYGLITCH.
          Trust the glitch. Your fortune is just one vibe away
